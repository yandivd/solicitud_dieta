"""Set the HTTPS certificate and private key for a website, assuming that these have been generated by the dehydrated
script that gets them from Let's Encrypt, and that they're in the standard place.  This script should normally only
be run on PythonAnywhere.

Usage:
  pa_install_webapp_letsencrypt_ssl.py <domain> [--suppress-reload]

Options:
  <domain>              Domain name, eg www.mydomain.com
  --suppress-reload     The website will need to be reloaded in order to activate the new certificate/key combination
                        -- this happens by default, use this option to suppress it.
